= Generating an Interface =
In Chapter 3 we learned how to use our search index to display results to the user.  But, sfSearch ships with a generator that can construct an entire search interface from a configuration file, just like symfony's CRUD and admin generators.

== Creating Generator Skeleton ==
To create the generator skeleton in the application "frontend", the module "search", and for the index "SiteSearch", we run:
{{{
./symfony search:init-interface frontend search SiteSearch
}}}

Be sure to replace the arguments with the information specific to your project.

This command will construct a skeleton module in {{{ apps/frontend/modules/search }}} and place the generator configuration file in {{{ apps/frontend/modules/search/config/generator.yml }}}. Like the admin generator, we modify thegenerator configuration to tailor the generated interface to our application requirements.

= Under Construction =
Coming Soon... I promise!
