    history: { en: "The responsibilities of the City Clerk were established with the Act of Incorporation in 1886, which declared the City Clerk to be the Returning Officer of the City (the official responsible for voters' lists and elections). Additional duties included purchasing supplies and were somewhat undefined. With the clarifications of the 1900 Act of Incorporation, formalized responsibilities included recording Council minutes, keeping custody of the by-laws, and maintaining financial records. The Clerk also received all mail directed to the City. A 1912 by-law assigned responsibility for facilitating communication between the citizens, the Mayor, Council, and Council's committees to the City Clerk. In a 1953 Act of Incorporation amendment, the Clerk was named as custodian of the City seal. With the exception of financial functions, which long ago passed to financial officers, the Clerk's responsibilities have remained remarkably consistent. The primary functions over time have been:\n\n    * taking minutes for the meetings of City Council and related bodies\n      \n    * keeping the records of the City of Vancouver as required by the Vancouver Charter\n      \n    * carrying out correspondence on behalf of Council\n      \n    * keeping all records related to City Council decision making (including large volumes of supporting documents)\n      \n    * assembling voters' lists and carrying out elections (for Council, the Park Board, the School Board, and on plebiscites)\n      \n    * providing communication, information, and public relations services, including responsibility for civic ceremonies\n      \n    * since 1970, responsibility for the Archives \n      \nFrom 1886 to 1974, the City Clerk reported directly to Council; from 1974 the position has been reporting to the City Manager's Office. Although the formal organization of the City Clerk's Department has in recent years consisted of a number of divisions - the Council secretariat, the Voters' List Division, periodically a small Public Relations/Communications Division, and the Archives and Records Division (since 1970) - in practice, the Office of the City Clerk has included all divisional sections except the Archives. During some periods the Office of the City Clerk was more commonly referred to as the City Clerk's Office, though the former has prevailed.\n\nThe following individuals have served as City Clerk:\n\n    * Thomas Francis McGuigan, 1886-1905\n      \n    * Arthur McEvoy, 1905-1907\n      \n    * William McQueen, 1907-1931\n      \n    * Charles Jones, 1931-1935\n      \n    * W. L. Woodford, 1935\n      \n    * Fred Howlett, 1935-1945 (acting 1935-1937)\n      \n    * Ronald Thompson, 1945-1973\n      \n    * Douglas Haig Little, 1973-1978\n      \n    * Robert Henry, 1978-1987\n      \n    * Maria Kinsella, 1987-1997\n      \n    * Ulli Watkiss, 1998-2001\n      \n    * Syd Baxter, 2001- " }

    history: { en: "Townley, Matheson and Partners was a major Vancouver architectural firm throughout most of the 20th century. It produced designs for over 1100 discrete projects including numerous landmark buildings in the Vancouver, most notably Vancouver City Hall. The partnership was formed in 1919 by Fred L. Townley (1887-1966) and Robert T. Matheson (1887-1935). \n\nTownley was the son of former Vancouver Mayor T.O. Townley. Townley and Matheson were both raised in Vancouver, and received their architectural training at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating together in 1911. The majority of the work the partnership did in its initial years was private residences and small scale commercial projects. It was responsible for the design of many prominent Shaughnessy homes. It also produced designs for numerous stores and offices, including approximately 100 automobile service stations in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island. The partnership achieved prominence in 1935 after it was awarded the contract to design Vancouver's new City Hall. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the partnership designed fewer residences and increasing numbers of commercial buildings, including numerous grocery stores and movie theatres. From the 1950s onward hospital design formed the most sizeable component of the partnership's business; projects included Vancouver General Hospital, Royal Columbian Hospital, Royal Jubilee Hospital, Mission Memorial Hospital, and others in British Columbia, as well as Lethbridge Municipal Hospital in Alberta. The partnership existed under several names throughout its existence:\n*Townley and Matheson (1919-1964)\n*Townley, Matheson & Associates (1965)\n*Townley & Matheson, Kelly, Humphrey & Ritchie (1966)\n*Townley, Matheson & Partners (1967-1974)\n \nAllen C. Kelly (1908-2001) and Leonard A. Humphrey were former associates who became partners in 1964; it is likely that Ross B. Ritchie became a partner at about the same time. In 1969 the partnership merged with the practice of Alfredo J. Luz, but retained the name Townley, Matheson & Partners." }

    authorized_form_of_name: { en: 'TeleLearning Network Inc' }
    history: { en: "The TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence (TL-NCE) was established in 1995 when the federal government's Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE) program awarded a grant to create a network of researchers from Canadian universities, focusing on the development and application of networked technologies in education and training. TeleLearning established a management office to administer its affairs, and on April 7 1997 the office incorporated under the Corporations Act as TeleLearning Network Inc. (TN Inc.), a not-for-profit corporation. Ostensibly two separate bodies, each with its own Board of Directors, in practice TL-NCE and TN Inc. were not distinct: Board members were identical for both and the same Board session dealt with the affairs of both. TL-NCE was the \"research face\" and TN Inc. the \"legal-administrative face\" of the same organization. TeleLearning's renewal application in 2001 for a second round of NCE funding was unsuccessful. The decision was made to close out the Network, and on September 30, 2002 the corporation was officially dissolved.\n\nTeleLearning's mandate was to research, develop and demonstrate effective knowledge-building pedagogies, implemented through telelearning; to support the development of a knowledge economy and learning society in Canada; and to transfer the resulting knowledge into Canadian organizations, institutions of learning and Canadian companies for worldwide exploitation. Its main functions were to organize further research and distribute funding to individual projects through seven distinct research themes; publicize research results through publications, reports, and conferences; promote cooperation among private, public and university sectors; and encourage the development of commercial applications and technologies through the formation of spin-off companies.\n\nTeleLearning was primarily funded by the federal government through the NCE programs of the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), and Industry Canada. Additional funding was obtained through TeleLearning membership fees from participating public and private-sector organizations, including international affiliates. The chief officers of the Network were the Network Leader, Network Co-Leader, and the Executive Director. The Board of Directors was responsible for the overall management and direction of the Network, with certain powers delegated to an appointed Executive Committee. Other committees advised the Board, including the Program Committee and the Knowledge and Technology Transfer Committee. Relations between the Network and member organizations was regulated by the Network Internal Agreement.\n\nTeleLearning's management office operated out of Simon Fraser University, which served as the Network's host institution. The main functions of the management office were disbursement of funds, NCE reporting, communications, member liaison, assistance with funding proposals, and conference organization. As host institution, SFU provided TeleLearning with office space, facilities, and some administrative services (e.g. payroll and finances).\n\nThe TeleLearning Network was originally built around four \"beacon technologies\": Collaboration Architecture and Design Resources for Telelearning (CadreTel), Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE), Teleform, and Virtual-University (Virtual-U). Over 240 public- and private-sector organizations participated in its projects, including over 130 faculty from 30 Canadian universities. The Network supported the growth of the online learning industry with the development of more than 45 software prototypes. Its spin-off companies included TELEStraining Inc., ClearMed Medical Knowledge Inc., Math Resources Inc., Nomino Inc., InVentures Incubator Inc., Cogigraph, the Portal for Online Objects in Learning (POOL), and TeleLearning Solutions Inc." }

Architectural drawing files specific to a particular project typically contain elevation and perspective drawings related to the design of an initial concept and proposal for the project, incorporations of revisions into the initial concept based on the clients input and practical considerations, detailed plans intended to guide construction work, and annotations and alterations to those plans made during construction. Some of the projects (approximately 1 in 10) did not receive approval to proceede, and contain material relating only to the initial proposal. Project photographs include pre- construction photos taken of the construction site used to assist in the initial planning, progress photographs used in the supervision of construction, as documentation of the techniques and practices used during construction and for reference purposes, and post construction photographs used to document the finished appearance of a project. Photographs were also incorporated into promotional material, as collections of albums shown to prospective clients, and in promotional publications. \n\nThe majority of the records relate to projects in the greater Vancouver area. Approximately 100 projects were undertaken on Vancouver Island, primarially in the Victoria region, but also in Duncan, Ladysmith, and Nanaimo. There are also records related to hospital projects in the Fraser Valley, several residences in the Okanagan, as well as two hospital projects in Lethbridge Alta. \n\nProjects initiated between 1919 and 1966 were numbered sequentially as job no. 1 through 1047. Jobs located in Victoria (B.C.) worked on between 1929 and ca. 1932 were numbered sequentially as job no. V-1 through V-14. Two jobs done in Penticton (B.C.) in 1936 are numbered sequentially as job nos. M- 1 and M-2. Begining in 1967, projects were assigned a 5 digit job number; the first 2 digits of the job number were the last 2 digits of the calendar year, followed by a hyphen and a 3 digit number (e.g. 67-014). Where known, job nos. have been incorporated into titles at the file and item levels." }
