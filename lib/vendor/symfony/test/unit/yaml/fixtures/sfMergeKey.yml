test: Simple In Place Substitution
brief: >
    If you want to reuse an entire alias, only overwriting what is different
    you can use a << in place substitution. This is not part of the official
    YAML spec, but a widely implemented extension. See the following URL for
    details: http://yaml.org/type/merge.html
yaml: |
    foo: &foo
        - Steve
        - Clark
        - Brian
    bar:
        <<: *foo
        - Oren
php: |
    array('foo' => array('Steve', 'Clark', 'Brian'), 'bar' => array('Steve', 'Clark', 'Brian', 'Oren'))
